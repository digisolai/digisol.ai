## Troubleshooting

### If the script fails:

1. **Check Django setup**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python manage.py check
   ```

2. **Verify superuser exists**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell
   >>> from accounts.models import CustomUser
   >>> CustomUser.objects.filter(is_superuser=True).first()
   ```

3. **Check tenant association**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell
   >>> from core.models import Tenant
   >>> Tenant.objects.all()
   ```

### If unlimited access doesn't work:

1. **Clear browser cache** and log out/in
2. **Check subscription data** in the browser console
3. **Verify the API response** shows unlimited limits (-1 values)
4. **Check if user is actually a superuser** in the database

## Customization

### To modify the unlimited plan:

Edit `backend/subscription_billing/management/commands/setup_superuser_unlimited.py`:

```python
# Change plan name
'name': 'Your Custom Plan Name',

# Modify limits
'contact_limit': -1,  # Keep unlimited
'email_send_limit': 50000,  # Set specific limit

# Add custom features
'includes_custom_feature': True,
```

### To set up different superusers:

```bash
python manage.py setup_superuser_unlimited --email another@email.com
```

## Security Notes

- This setup is for **marketing and demonstration purposes only**
- The unlimited plan has **no cost** and **10-year duration**
- **Regular users cannot access this plan** - it's superuser-only
- **Production data is safe** - this only affects the superuser account

## Next Steps

1. **Test all features** as your superuser account
2. **Create marketing materials** showcasing the full platform
3. **Demonstrate to prospects** without upgrade interruptions
4. **Monitor regular user experience** with the new upgrade prompts
5. **Adjust upgrade messaging** based on user feedback
